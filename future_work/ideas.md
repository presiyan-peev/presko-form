# Future Work Ideas for PreskoForm

Here are some potential directions for new features, considering the headless nature of the library:

1.  **Advanced Validation:** Asynchronous rules, cross-field validation.
2.  **Enhanced Form State:** Dirty/touched status for fields, overall form state (isSubmitting, etc.), field-specific events.
3.  **Array/List Handling:** Better support for repeatable blocks of fields (e.g., dynamic lists of contacts).
4.  **Accessibility Helpers:** Guidance or auto-generated ARIA links for errors (while respecting user components).
5.  **Validation Rule Plugin System:** Allow users to easily add new global validation rules.
6.  **Conditional/Dynamic Fields:** Declarative ways to show/hide fields based on other field values.
7.  **Focus Management:** Programmatic focus on the first invalid field.
